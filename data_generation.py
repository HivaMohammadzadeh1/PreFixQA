                    1. **Correctness**: Is the answer factually accurate and grounded in the document?\
                    2. **Agreement**: Does the answer directly address the question and provide a relevant response?\

                    **Important considerations for rating:**\
                    - Rate vague or overly general questions lower, especially if they lack specificity or do not make sense in the context of the document.\
                    - Rate answers where the model, dataset, or method is unclear or missing details lower.\
                    - If the answer states that the information is not in the document, confirm by reviewing the document. If the information is indeed missing, rate the answer highly. If it is present, rate the answer lower.\
                    - Avoid focusing on questions about appendix numbers, or formatting details (like section names).\
                    - Avoid asking questions that have 2 possible answers. if there are 2 possible answers and only one is provided, rate the answers low.\
                    - If the answer is about a range, pay attention to the range and if there are negative signs. \
                    - Avoid asking questions that are taken from the 'References' and 'ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS' sections. if there are such questions, rate the answers low.\
