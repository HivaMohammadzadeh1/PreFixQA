        "text": "# Introduction\n\nThe droplet evaporation is a ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in many natural and industrial processes. A few common examples are drying of drops in food/chemical industries, evaporative cooling of electronic devices, and fuel droplet vaporization inside combustion engines. The evaporation of drops is also a crucial process in pharmaceutical industries. The evaporation of liquid droplets has been investigated under distinct configurations, including the sessile mode, where the droplet rests on a solid substrate, and the pendant mode, where the droplet is suspended from a needle or wire. Droplet evaporation involves a multitude of transport processes (heat, mass, and momentum) and ambient conditions (pressure, temperature, and humidity). Brutin and Starov categorically summarised the evaporation of droplets on a substrate and discussed various parameters affecting the evaporation process, such as wettability, thermal effects, and associated flow instabilities. However, drying drops in pendant configuration lead to distinct evaporation characteristics compared to the sessile mode. In many industrial applications, such as spray drying and spray combustion, the droplet remains contactless. Therefore, understanding the evaporation characteristics of an isolated contactless drop becomes crucial.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on multi-component liquids such as"

This interest stems from their ability to mitigate harmful emissions (NOx) and enhance engine efficiency. The study of droplet evaporation is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of their spray and combustion behavior. The addition of water to these fuels can impact the evaporation rate and potentially affect their spray and combustion characteristics. For instance, the addition of water tends to lower the combustion temperature since water exhibits exceptionally high heat capacity, resulting in a significant reduction in NO production. Furthermore, water-in-oil emulsion fuels can potentially improve the atomization characteristics inside the combustion chamber by undergoing vapor bubble-induced breakup. While extensive research has been carried out on the atomization characteristics of emulsion fuels, a critical knowledge gap exists regarding their evaporation behavior."

        "text": "# Research Findings\n\nShen et al. reported that upon heating the emulsion droplet, there exists a threshold temperature beyond which the interfacial tension between the water/oil interface increases abruptly. As a result, the water sub-droplets can no longer remain dispersed in oil, and depending on the threshold temperature, the dispersed water droplet can either diffuse towards the surface (eventually vaporize) or undergo coalescence resulting in complete phase separation. A recent study explored the evaporation of sessile water-in-oil emulsion droplets and investigated the capillary clustering of water sub-droplets on the evaporation rate. Similarly, it has been shown that for sessile water-in-cyclohexane emulsion droplets, the evaporation rate can be controlled by varying the water concentration. Emulsions and their distinct evaporation characteristics are also utilized extensively for making engineered particles. For instance, porous particles can be produced by spray-drying of emulsions. Such particles are useful in pharmaceutical applications such as pulmonary drug delivery systems."

The size of dispersed phase sub-droplets in these emulsions is typically above 1 μm. Such systems are milky white and kinetically stable (i.e., eventually undergo phase separation with time).38,39 The stability of the emulsions depends on parameters such as the size distribution of the dispersed sub-droplets, the volume fraction of water sub-droplets, surfactant properties, and preparation method.40,41\n\nIt is established that the microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, optically transparent, and relatively simple to prepare.42–45 The microemulsions used in this study exhibit ultra-long stability (up to 180 days44,45), making them a viable option as a model alternative fuel for combustion applications. Thermodynamic stability of these emulsions is achieved due to the self-organization of the surfactant molecules at the interface between oil and water sub-droplets, which leads to a decrease in the surface energy of the system.\n\nIn this work, we investigate the evaporation characteristics of microemulsion droplets in a contactless environment using an infrared laser. Heating with laser offers a significant advantage over conventional droplet heating methods by enabling precise control over the heating rate. To better understand the evaporation process, we employ a non-intrusive method that involves complete isolation of the droplet. This isolation eliminates any external interactions that could potentially influence the evaporation rate.\n\nWe report that a microemulsion droplet undergoes three distinct stages during the evaporation process, viz., pre-heating (Stage I), steady evaporation (Stage II), and unsteady evaporation (Stage III). Following evaporation, the droplet transforms into a solid residual structure. The global overview of these stages is provided in section 3.1. Subsequently, a detailed understanding of these evaporation processes is provided based on microemulsion structure, tuned using parameters ω, the molar ratio; ε, the volume fraction and the nature of the base oil, in sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and 3.2.3. An in-depth discussion on shell formation and its dependence on the microemulsion parameters is presented in the section 3.2.3. We also propose a parameter ϑ referred to as the volume."

The characteristics of these microemulsions are characterized based on two parameters: (1) molar ratio of water to AOT (i.e., ω) and (2) dispersed phase volume fraction (i.e., ε). The ω and ε are defined as\n\nω = [AOT] / [H2O] and, ε = VH2O / (VHO + VAOT + VAOT + Voil)\n\nwhere [H2O] and [AOT] denotes the number of moles of water and AOT, respectively, and V denotes the volume of different components. The parameters ω and ε can be used as handles to tune the size and number density of water sub-droplets in the microemulsions. As evident from Equation 1, increase in the concentration of water leads to increase in the values of ω and ε and is typically used as a handle to tune the size and the number density of the dispersed water sub-droplets.\n\nFor a given value of ω and ε, the corresponding mass of the continuous oil phase and AOT in the water-in-oil microemulsions can be calculated using Equation 1 by providing the mass of water as an additional input variable. To prepare the microemulsion samples, a pre-determined quantity of AOT is precisely weighed and transferred into pre-cleaned glass vials. Subsequently, an appropriate amount of the oil is added to the vials. The mixture is then shaken gently for a few minutes (depending on the relative quantity of AOT and oil) until the AOT is completely dissolved in the oil phase. Later, a weighed amount of deionized water is added to the oil-AOT mixture and shaken gently until the resulting sample becomes a single-phase optically clear fluid. The samples were stored for 3-4 hours at room temperature (25 ℃) to ensure equilibration and homogeneity before any experiments or characterization.\n\nTo study the effect of ω and the nature of the continuous oil phase, microemulsions were prepared using decane as the oil phase at various ω values: 5, 10, 20, and 40. Furthermore, dodecane microemulsions were formulated at two ω (= 10 and 20) values, whereas p-xylene"

Soon after the droplet is exposed to the irradiation, it starts to heat up, and its temperature increases until it reaches a constant value. The temperature rise causes the droplet to undergo evaporation, as a result, the droplet loses its mass and the diameter of the droplet reduces marginally. At the end of evaporation, the formation of a spherical solid residue is observed. As time progresses, this spherical residue undergoes buckling due to the acoustic pressure and stresses generated during the course of evaporation. The formation of the shell is a unique phenomenon observed for microemulsions, primarily due to the non-volatile nature of the surfactant (AOT) used in this work.

As a result, the droplet’s surface temperature also rises until it becomes constant. Following this, the droplet starts to evaporate, and the irradiation energy absorbed by the droplet during this phase is utilized to vaporize liquid from the droplet surface in the form of latent heat. Consequently, due to the mass loss from the droplet surface, the pure liquid droplet undergoes near-complete evaporation, reaching a final diameter significantly smaller than its initial size (D(t)/D0 ↔ 0.1 ± 0.05). Once the droplet reaches this size, it becomes undetectable within the limitations of the current experimental setup, either due to visualization limitations or loss of stable levitation in the acoustic levitator.\n\nThe fundamental difference between a pure liquid and a microemulsion droplet is that the pure liquid consists of a single component whereas microemulsions are multi-component systems, which typically contain a base oil (i.e., continuous phase), water (i.e., dispersed phase), and a stabilizer or surfactant. In this study, we use microemulsions (water-AOT-oil) droplet, which has nanometer-sized water sub-droplets dispersed into the continuous phase (oil), where a monolayer of surfactant (AOT) stabilizes the interface between the water and oil, as shown in the Figure 5(a). The microemulsions are a ternary system and quaternary for the surrogate microemulsion (water-AOT-dodecane-xylene) and their evaporation characteristics depend on the molar ratio of water to AOT (ω), and dispersed phase volume fraction (ε).44,47\n\nThe evaporation of a microemulsion droplet has been observed to occur in three different stages, where the first two stages (namely preheating and steady evaporation) are similar to that for single-component droplet evaporation. An additional stage (Stage III) referred to as unsteady evaporation stage is observed, where the droplet evaporation rate continuously decreases until the evaporation completely stops, which is attributed to the non-volatile."

As discussed before, vaporization at the surface of the droplet is the combination of continuous vaporization of bulk liquid (base oil) and intermittent vaporization of water sub-droplets once exposed at the surface. As ε increases, the corresponding volume percentage of the base oil in the microemulsion droplet decreases (the volume percent of different components in a microemulsion droplet is tabulated in Table S1 for ω = 10 and 40).\n\nFor instance, a droplet with ε = 0.1 signifies a 90% oil composition by volume, with the remaining 10% constituting the dispersed phase (comprises of water and AOT dictated by ω (see Equation 1)).

From Figure 7 and Figure 8(a), it is evident that the difference in evaporation rate between ε = 0.1 and 0.2 is minimal, whereas a significant reduction occurs for ε = 0.4. The significant decrease in evaporation rate can be attributed to the higher concentration of AOT.

However, the dodecane microemulsion exhibits a much lower evaporation rate for all the values of ε except at ε = 0.4. The evaporation characteristics of the microemulsions having different base oils can be partially explained based on the vapor pressure (pv) of base oil. The vapor pressure of dodecane, decane, and xylene are of the order O(10−2), O(10−1), and O(101) respectively, as shown in the Table 1.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the characteristics of the base oil primarily control evaporation, and since the vapor pressure of dodecane is one order lower than decane, the dodecane shows a much lower evaporation rate compared to the decane microemulsion. However, despite xylene having the highest vapor pressure among all the base oils, the xylene microemulsion shows an evaporation rate similar to that of decane microemulsion at I↓ = 0.05. The evaporation of a microemulsion droplet is a complex process not solely governed by the characteristics of base oil. Additional factors, such surfactant agglomeration, possibly the nanostructure, can significantly influence the overall evaporation rate.\n\nThe relatively reduced evaporation rate of the xylene microemulsion can be attributed to the interplay between the vapor pressure of base oil and the agglomeration of surfactant. Due to its high vapor pressure, xylene initially evaporates rapidly from the droplet surface. This rapid evaporation leads to an early and significant rise in the relative concentration of non-volatile AOT at the surface. These particles lack sufficient time to diffuse and achieve a homogeneous distribution throughout the droplet. The high concentration of AOT slows the transport of liquid components toward the droplet surface, effectively limiting the evaporation rate of xylene by reducing the effective surface area for evaporation. It is important to distinguish this Stage from a phase where the droplet surface is entirely covered with AOT particles (which comes much later), effectively halting evaporation."

Between the end of Stage II and the point where the evaporation rate approaches zero is called the unsteady evaporation phase (i.e., Stage III). Most of the liquid components evaporate during Stage II. As a result, the relative concentration of surfactant inside the droplet increases drastically at this Stage (II). This creates a liquid-deficient droplet with high AOT concentration. As time progresses, the transport of liquid components to the surface becomes even more difficult. Because of these two phenomena, the evaporation rate of the microemulsion droplet decreases continuously until the evaporation completely stops. Figure 9(b) and (d) show the evaporation time during the unsteady evaporation phase of the droplet. It is observed that the droplet with a lower value of ϑ exhibits a larger evaporation time (”t ue).

        "text": "# Evaporation Dynamics of Microemulsions\n\nHigher concentration of the AOT relative to the concentration of volatile components (oil and water) leading to an early transition from steady to unsteady evaporation (see Figure 7). As a result, the majority of the liquid evaporation occurs during Stage III and at a slower rate, which leads to an increase in unsteady evaporation time scale (”tue).\n\nUnlike pure liquids, complete evaporation of the droplet does not occur, instead a residual material, often referred to as a “shell\" remains following the evaporation process. The basis of the formation of this spherical solid shell can be attributed to the rapid packing of agglomerated AOT particles at the droplet surface compared to their diffusion to the bulk. 57,61\n\nThe formation of this spherical shell suggests that a significant amount of the microemulsion components continue to remain even after the evaporation stops. This un-evaporated mass of the droplet gets encapsulated by a layer of agglomerated surfactant, completely closing the shell and thus preventing further mass transfer from the droplet. However, this residue formed post-evaporation is not unique to the microemulsion droplets. These shell-like structures have been observed for several multi-component droplets containing non-volatile components, for instance, nano-particle laden droplets58,62, polymeric droplets63 and even in biological fluids such as respiratory droplets64,65.\n\nWhile in all such cases, the evaporating droplet results in residue formation, the characteristics of this residue differ significantly. For instance, respiratory droplets do not undergo buckling (a phenomenon observed in the present work, which will be discussed further) but instead show crystal formation66.\n\nAt the onset of the shell formation, droplet evaporation stops, which translates to a negligible change in the size of the residual structure. ( ddtD(t)2 ↔ 0) Therefore, this should indicate a zero slope in the diameter vs time curve (see Figure 4(c), Figure 7). As evident from the figures, it is difficult to ascertain the point where the droplet evaporation ends. We observe a persistent reduction in droplet size (D(t)2/D02) for a significant time interval (10 - 30 seconds), even after the shell formation. To elucidate this unexpected observation, a detailed analysis of droplet diameter evolution is carried out. Figure 10 (a) presents the temporal evolution of horizontal (Dh) and vertical (Dv) characteristic lengths.\n\n29"

It is observed that, during stages II and III, the horizontal and vertical diameters reduce proportionally with the equivalent diameter. For an evaporating droplet, it is expected that both of its characteristic diameters (horizontal and vertical) should decrease with time as a result of a reduction in the overall droplet volume. However, a significant deviation from this anticipated behavior of the droplet diameters has been observed after point C, as shown in Figure 10(a). While the horizontal diameter appears to reach a plateau, indicating minimal change in droplet size with time, the vertical diameter continues to decrease in size. This discrepancy between the horizontal and vertical diameter variations is attributed to the buckling of the spherical shell. The evaporation is considered to stop at the point (C), where the horizontal diameter becomes constant.\n\n|Decane|Surrogate|Xylene|Dodecane|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|=0.4|=0.1|=0.4|=0.4|\n|2|3| | |\n\nFigure 11: SEM images of the residue are shown for different values of ε and irradiation (I ↓ ) at ω = 10.

The curvature-induced capillary force pulls the liquid out of the pores and pulls the spherical shell inwards, eventually leading to the buckling of the shell. In addition to capillary forces, acoustic radiation forces acting on the droplet might also influence the observed shell buckling phenomenon. It is observed that the buckling primarily occurs at the north (N) and south (S) poles of the shell, which are also seen in the SEM images of the residual shell (Figure 11 at I↓ = 0.05).\n\nThis observation suggests a potential role of acoustic pressure in the buckling phenomenon, particularly since the droplet is subjected to a continuous acoustic field. Notably, the spherical shell may not always undergo buckling. A spherical shell morphology can also be observed at the end of Stage III, which is referred to as shell jamming (see Figure 11 at I↓ = 0.1).\n\nXylene microemulsion at I↓ = 0.1 is observed that initially, the north pole of the shell buckles, which is followed by buckling in the south pole (see Figure 4(b)). The observed behavior can be attributed to the influence of gravity. During evaporation, the liquid within the droplet may tend to accumulate at the south pole due to gravitational pull and surface tension forces acting at the interface ensure the spherical shape."

        "text": "# Final Diameter of the Residual Spherical Shell\n\nThe final diameter of the residual spherical shell at the end of Stage III is measured from the shadowgraph images. The shell size depends on both the evaporation rate and the volume fraction ratio (ϑ) of the volatile to non-volatile components within the parent droplet. Figure 10(b) and (c) show the variation of the shell size (D) as a function of ϑ at I↓ = 0.05s and 0.1, respectively. It can be seen that a higher shell size D is inversely proportional to the volume fraction ratio (Ds ≃ 1/ϑ).\n\nThe shell size of the xylene microemulsion exhibits large shell sizes compared to the other microemulsions. The larger shell size can be attributed to the high vapor pressure of xylene which leads to its faster evaporation. Therefore, the rate of accumulation of AOT particles is much faster than their diffusion/transport throughout the droplet causing an early and larger shell formation. Typically, for xylene microemulsion, no buckling has been observed at a higher heating rate (see Figure 11). The faster evaporation rate of xylene causes the shell to form early such that the solid residual structure can sustain."

The key evaporation characteristics of stable emulsion droplets are as follows.\n\n1. The microemulsion droplet exhibits three distinct stages of evaporation: pre-heating, steady evaporation, and unsteady evaporation. At the end of evaporation, the droplets result in a spherical residue.\n2. Pre-heating corresponds to the transient heating period of the droplet, where its surface temperature increases and becomes constant after a certain time period, i.e., preheating time (”tph). The ranges from ”tph ↔ 1.72 seconds at irradiation intensity of I↓ = 0.05, whereas it reduces to ↔ 0.76 seconds at I↓ = 0.1.\n3. During Stage II, the droplet undergoes steady evaporation, and the rate of evaporation is observed to decrease with the increase in ε for a constant ω. It is shown that the evaporation of a microemulsion droplet is governed by the complex interplay between its constituents and their properties. A parameter ϑ was introduced, which indicates the cumulative influence of various factors (ε, ω) affecting the evaporation process."
